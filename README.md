# Flip
Flip is a Xamarin mobile application that allows the user to build and cycle through user-defined flashcard decks. 

Upon opening the application, the user is presented with all decks currently stored as well as the option to add a new deck. Through an individual deck,
a user can manage the deck by adding, editing, and deleting cards. The user can also traverse cards in the deck.

Below are snapshots from a Pixel 3 Pie 9.0 Android emulator.



Main Page with link to either create new deck or navigate an existing:
